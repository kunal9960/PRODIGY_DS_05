# Prodigy Data Science Task 05 üìù


## Description

Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.


## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns and insights related to various factors such as road conditions, weather, and time of day. By analyzing these patterns, we can better understand the circumstances surrounding accidents and potentially identify areas for improvement in road safety measures. The project involves preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing accident hotspots, and identifying contributing factors to accidents.


## Usage

- Ensure Python and necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) are installed.
- Download the traffic accident dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
- Run the provided script or notebook to execute data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and insights extraction.
- **Dataset Used** - [Traffic Accident Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/road-traffic-accidents)
